1. Start and Initialization:
        Initialize variables and add event listeners to the tabs.
        
2. Tab Switching Logic:
        When switching tabs, determine the current and new tab states.
        If switching to the "Search Weather" tab, hide user weather info and grant access container, and show the search form.
        If switching to the "User Weather" tab, hide the search form, and either show the grant access container
        (if coordinates are not available) or fetch weather info using stored coordinates.

3. Check Session Storage:
        Check if user coordinates are available in session storage.
        If found, fetch weather info.
        If not found, show the grant access container.

4. Grant Location Access:
        On clicking the grant access button, attempt to get the user's location.
        Save the coordinates to session storage and fetch weather info.

5. Fetch User Weather Info:
        Make an API call to fetch weather information based on the user's coordinates.
        Show the loading screen while fetching data.
        Render the fetched weather info and display it on the UI.

6. Search Weather by City:

        On form submission, validate the input city name.
        If valid, fetch weather info based on the city name.
        Show the loading screen while fetching data.
        Render the fetched weather info and display it on the UI.
